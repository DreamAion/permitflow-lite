PermitFlowAutomation
Streamlining Permit Review with GPT-4 and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Summary
PermitFlow Lite is a lightweight tool built to extract structured information from complex permitting documents. It uses GPT-4 and RAG techniques to simplify and accelerate traditionally manual, time-consuming workflows—without needing deep technical expertise. This project demonstrates how modern language models can be applied to real-world challenges like document understanding and compliance automation.

What It Does
When provided with an unstructured permit document (from plain text or a PDF), the system:

Breaks the document into searchable sections

Uses vector similarity search (FAISS) to find the most relevant content

Sends that context to GPT-4 to extract structured, meaningful information

The output includes:

Applicant Name

Project Address

Scope of Work

Approval Date

This setup mimics the type of intelligent document review seen in permitting automation tools used by companies like PermitFlow.

Why It Matters
Permit review often involves dense, inconsistent paperwork. This project shows how combining semantic search with large language models can reduce manual effort and help teams find key information faster and more reliably.
